Welcome to my HangMan game! ðŸ˜ƒ

I made this game to practice my CSS and JS. It ended up being a lot less CSS than anticipated, but it was really good practice for coding in vanilla JS.

You can find the link to the game, hosted on GitHub Pages, above.
I hope you enjoy it!

Please feel free to add to the array of words that the game draws upon by creating a pull request for the script.js file!

Also, if you notice any bugs or have feedback, please let me know, I am always looking to get better!
